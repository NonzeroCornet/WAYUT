# WAYUT
This is a thingy I made for the Christa McAuliffe Space Center Flight Directors.

## Install
Just download the code as a zip file and extract it.

## Use
In the same directory as the index.js file, run ```PORT=[desired port] node index.js```.
You can then press the buttons and type stuff and it should update on all clients.
