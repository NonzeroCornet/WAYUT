# WAYUT (why-uh-t)
This is a thingy I made for the Christa McAuliffe Space Center Flight Directors.

## Requirements
NodeJS v18.16 or greater<br>
NPM 9.5.1 or greater

## Install
Just download the code as a zip file and extract it. You can download it [here](https://github.com/NonzeroCornet/WAYUT/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). In the same directory as the package.json file, run ```npm install```.

## Use
In the same directory as the index.js file, run ```PORT=[desired port] node index.js```.
You can then press the buttons and type stuff and it should update on all clients.
